# Storefront - Node and Express Back-End

## About the Project

This project was the first project I completed on my own. It is a mock ecommerce site with the functionality that you'd expect. You can view pages of products, each product has its own page, you can search, add products to a cart, view orders, and checkout with Stripe. As the project progressed, the scope of it grew as well. I had originally only been usng tools that I'd learned in the courses that I'd completed, but I decided that I should learn more. I added TypeScript because I'd read a lot of articles about how great it is (I know), I added Formik to help manage my forms, and then Stripe so that I could simulate a more realistic checkout.

The front-end was built using React, TypeScript, styled-components, axios, React Router, Stripe, and some Redux, while the back-end was built using Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, TypeScript, Stripe, and more.

This is the repository for the Node and Express backend. You can [view the deployed site](https://storefront-app.netlify.app) or [view the repository for the React front-end](https://github.com/jgoodier1/storefront).

## Purpose and Goals

The purpose of this project was to build something by myself. I started this after completed courses on React and Node, and I felt that I was ready to take the dive and start something myself. I decided to build an ecommerce site because the Node course I had completed built one, so I had some familiarity which made the idea of doing it myself less imposing. Since I had just finished the courses, my only goal was to get comfortable using React and Node so that I could move on to bigger and better things.
