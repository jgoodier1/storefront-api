# Storefront API

This is the repository of the api for my 'Storefront' site. The deployed site is [here](https://storefront-app.netlify.app).The client repository can be viewed [here](https://github.com/jgoodier1/storefront) and my LinkedIn [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-goodier-b64a5586/).

This back-end was built using Node and Express, with a PostgreSQL database.
